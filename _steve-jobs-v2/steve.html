          <h2>Early life and education</h2>

          <h3>Family</h3>

          <p>
            Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February
            24, 1955, to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah "John" Jandali
            (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي). Jandali was born in a Muslim household
            to wealthy Syrian parents, the youngest of nine siblings.
          </p>

          <p>
            Schieble requested that her son be adopted by college graduates. A
            lawyer and his wife were selected, but they withdrew after
            discovering that the baby was a boy, so Jobs was instead adopted by
            Paul Reinhold and Clara (née Hagopian) Jobs. Paul Jobs was the son
            of a dairy farmer; after dropping out of high school, he worked as a
            mechanic, then joined the U.S. Coast Guard.
          </p>

          <h3>Infancy</h3>
          <div class="text-side">
            <p>
              In his youth, Jobs's parents took him to a Lutheran church. When
              Steve was in high school, Clara admitted to his girlfriend,
              Chrisann Brennan, that she "was too frightened to love Steve for
              the first six months of his life … I was scared they were going to
              take him away from me."
            </p>

                Of all the inventions of humans, the computer is going to rank
                near or at the top as history unfolds and we look back. It is
                the most awesome tool that we have ever invented. I feel
                incredibly lucky to be at exactly the right place in Silicon
                Valley, at exactly the right time, historically, where this
                invention has taken form.

              Paul Jobs worked in several jobs that included a try as a
              machinist, several other jobs, and then "back to work as a
              machinist". Paul and Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957
              and by 1959 the family had moved to the Monta Loma neighborhood in
              Mountain View, California. Paul built a workbench in his garage
              for his son in order to "pass along his love of mechanics".

                I always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but
                I liked electronics … then I read something that one of my
                heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of
                people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and
                sciences, and I decided that's what I wanted to do.
